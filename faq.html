              <ul class="quesandans-list clearfix">
                <h5 class="faq-sechead">Getting Started</h5>
                <li>How difficult is it to transfer my service (email provider, domain, etc.) over to the service that Secured Nexus™ provides? Is there going to be any down time?</li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Secured Nexus™ will work with you to help you move your domain. Depending upon your current email provider or in-house solution, we can help you understand the process. All that is necessary to move your domain is to move your DNS records to point to our servers and we take care of the email setup. Depending upon who houses your DNS record, it may take anywhere from 1 hour to 48 hours for the records to propagate through the Internet. Your current email can be safely moved to the new server. We recommend that you clean up old email before moving as a best practice. </div>
                <li class="last">If I need help is there customer service to assist me? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix"> Absolutely. Secured Nexus™ has a 24 hour Call Center that is able to serve you and solve your problems as quickly as possible. On the occasion that there is a complex problem, your issue will be escalated to Technicians that are able to solve your issues. </div>
                <h5 class="faq-sechead">Encryption</h5>
                <li>What is Encryption?</li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Encryption is the conversion of data into a form, called a ciphertext, which cannot be easily understood by unauthorized people. You must have the ability to “decode” or Decrypt the information using a highly technical process of converting the data back into its regular form so it can be understood. </div>
                <li>I understand encryption, how does yours work? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">We encrypt and decrypt your incoming and outgoing email at the gateway level, meaning before it leaves the server and as soon as it comes back to the server. We use S/MIME and PDF Encryption. S/MIME provides authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation (using X.509 certificates) and protection against message interception. S/MIME uses public key encryption (PKI) for encryption and signing. All of this is done automatically for you.</div>
                <li class="last">How do you secure my PDF documents? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">We use a 20 byte one-time password encryption key which can be changed per user. Your receiver can generate his one-time password (OTP) by our 4096-Bit encrypted portal.  The receiver can then reply directly from the encrypted PDF for continued end-to-end encryption.</div>
                <h5 class="faq-sechead">General</h5>
                <li>What is the difference in Secured Nexus™ and other servers? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Secured Nexus™ offers end to end encryption. This means that the flow of data from one end to the other is encrypted. We offer offshore Jurisdiction, which means that your data is only subject to Panamanian law.</div>
                <li>Do I need these products? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">If you have security concerns about communication, you need truly Secure Communication Tools that are in a Jurisdiction that values and protects your Privacy and does NOT spy on you. The Solution is Secured Nexus™. If you want to make sure that no one is reading your Email, reading your Instant Messaging, listening to your Phone Calls, watching your Video Chats, then it is time to make the change to Secured Nexus™ and privatize your communications. It’s widely known that the U.S. and other governments are watching and reading whether you desire them to do so or not.</div>
                <li>How can the products benefit me and my company?</li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Peace of mind and security. As long as you follow our best practices, you can be assured that your communication is fully encrypted and protected from prying eyes.</div>
                <li class="last">Is the service going to cost more than what I already use? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Secured Nexus™ is unique in that there are no other companies offering the array of Secure Communication Tools that are TRULY Private and Secure. With that in mind, it is difficult to compare since there are so many services available and those services do NOT offer the same Security and Privacy.</div>
                <h5 class="faq-sechead">Legal</h5>
                <li>How do I know that the US government can’t shut down Secured Nexus™ after I subscribe? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Secured Nexus™ is not subject to US jurisdiction. The US can request information from Panama as long as a law has been broken according to Panama.</div>
                <li>Can the US track my IP address when I log onto the servers in Secured Nexus™? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">If you use a browser such as Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, you can be tracked. Best practices would be to use the Tor Browser available here: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en. And use HTTPS Everywhere available here: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere</div>
                <li class="last">Is there a protocol that keeps criminals from using the service?</li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">There is no where to 100% guarantee that people will use the service correctly. Secured Nexus™ does not condone nor will it knowingly tolerate ANY use of the service that is for nefarious purposes. We place users on notice when they sign up what our policy is and have them agree to such usage.</div>
                <h5 class="faq-sechead">Email</h5>
                <li>Is there an online webmail interface?</li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Yes</div>
                <li>Do you offer IMAP or POP support? </li>
                <div class="answer-wrap clearfix">Yes</div>
