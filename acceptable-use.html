          <p>GOSECURED.COM&trade; will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its Clients to ensure that they comply with GOSECURED.COM&trade; policy or applicable law. When GOSECURED.COM&trade; becomes aware of harmful activities, however, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or take any other action it deems appropriate.</p>

This means that if GOSECURED.COM&trade; is sued because of a Client’s or customer of a Client’s activity, the Client will pay any damages awarded against GOSECURED.COM&trade;, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>

                  In my quest to find a secure email service alternative I talked to a number of different mail providers and you guys are the only one who had the easy to use and offshore location I think is needed. Most other providers were in the U.S. or didn't seem to have the service I was looking for. Keep up the good work! We will be switching to your encrypted Skype and secure dorpbox alternative as fast as I can manage it and migrate to you guys exclusively.</div>

                 <p>GoSecured VC is packed with amazing features. You get one-on-one and group video calling, text and picture messaging, screen sharing, free voice calling, and more while all staying completely encrypted with almost no extra effort. </p>
<p>
We needed to rethink your digital communications strategy and switch to a secure messaging program. Members of our company where all using different platforms such as skype, SnapChat, Facebook chat, WhatsApp, or Google chat. As part of a campaign to find "secure and usable crypto," we evaluated 29 messaging products ranging from chat clients, text messaging apps, email applications, and voice and video call tools to find what would work for all our employees to unify. In the End it was the features and ease to stay secure in GoSecured VC and messaging that made us switch. </p></div>
